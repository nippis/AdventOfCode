# Advent of Code

My solutions for https://adventofcode.com/

I treat these puzzles as a playground for experimenting with language features and alternative approaches,  
rather than writing the simplest or most maintainable solutions.

Recently my focus has been on exploring C++20 and C++23.  
This code is intentionally experimental — a snapshot of ideas, not an example of my production style.
